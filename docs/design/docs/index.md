# `riff.jv`

This is a distributed task scheduling framework built in Java, inspired by the open-source
project [XXL-Job](https://github.com/xuxueli/xxl-job).

## Why the name `riff.jv`?

The name **`riff.jv`** is inspired by the concept of a **"riff"** in music â€” a short, repetitive musical phrase that creates
rhythm and structure. Similarly, **`riff.jv`** is designed to repeatedly schedule and execute tasks in a distributed
environment, bringing rhythm and reliability to background job processing.

The **".jv"** suffix stands for Java, indicating that the framework is implemented in `Java`.
